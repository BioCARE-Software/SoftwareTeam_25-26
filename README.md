# Welcome to BioCare's Software Team's Github Repo 🦾

## Overview 📌
This repository contains both the firmware and software stack for Carleton University's Biomedical Applied Research and Engineering team. Our goal is to design and build a robust, effective, and user - friendly prosthetic arm to compete in the 2028 Cybathalon, based in Switzerland 🇨🇭.
The software team looks to seamlessly integrate with both hardware, control systems, as well as a mobile application to elevate user experience, and allow our team to better run diagnostics on our prosthetic.

## As a team, we are responsible for:
  - Processing sensor inputs (EMG signals, force sensors, etc)
  - Implementating gesture recognition and control algorithms from signals
  - Managing communication layers between:
          - Device <-> App. (Bluetooth - BLE)
          - ESP32 <-> Arduino Nano (UART)
  - Designing and launching a suitable mobile application for further user customization, calibration, and feedback between the device (React Native)
